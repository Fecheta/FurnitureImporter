Hereâ€™s the revised text reflecting that the Angular app is integrated but not deployed on the server:

The project is built using Hexagonal Architecture, designed to support a microservices approach. All components are decoupled through the use of interfaces, and data is hardcoded, with no database used.

The server is deployed on Google Cloud using a Docker image stored in the Container Registry and run via Cloud Run. The implementation includes customers, furniture items, and a strategy for calculating discounted prices for each customer.

An Angular frontend is integrated but is not deployed on the server; currently, only the server API is accessible.
